## Summary
Transport Management System App is an application used to automate shipping process in order to maximize the utilization of vehicle’s cargo volume and find the optimal and efficient route so that reduce transport cost and improve the observability of the moving items until arrived to the desired destination point.

The current shipping process is performed manually i.e. item’s data collection, item sorting based on destination point, courier and vehicle handover, tracking item status and finding the efficient shipping route, etc. Those stuffs are heavy duty tasks when performed manually, difficult to observe and track item location and status, and prone to the risk of human error.
